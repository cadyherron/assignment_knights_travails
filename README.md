Julia, Kit, and Ellen

1. What data structure is used to implement DFS?   

2. What data structure is typically used to implement BFS?
3. Which one can be done recursively? (the clue should be the data structure)
4. Which one would you use to print a list of all the nodes in a tree or graph, starting with depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3 etc.?
5. What is the difference between a tree and a graph?
